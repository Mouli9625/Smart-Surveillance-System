# Smart-Surveillance-System
ABSTRACT:
  we present a Smart Surveillance System designed to enhance security and monitoring capabilities. The system incorporates both face detection and object detection models, utilizing YOLO (You Only Look Once) for efficient object detection. To train the YOLO model, a custom dataset was curated and labeled, facilitating accurate object recognition. Additionally, reference images were employed for face detection tasks. The system operates by comparing detected faces against reference images; if a match is found, no action is taken. However, if an unrecognized face is detected, the system triggers object detection, capturing images and sending alerts via email through SMTP. This integrated approach provides a robust solution for real-time surveillance and security applications.
